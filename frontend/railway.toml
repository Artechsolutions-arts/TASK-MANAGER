# Railway config for Frontend (React/Vite)
# Set this service's Root Directory to "frontend" in Railway dashboard.
# Use Dockerfile so dist/ is built in-image and served reliably (avoids Nixpacks 404).

[build]
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
# Use image CMD (serve -s dist -l $PORT); do not override so dist/ is definitely served
# watchPatterns = ["dist"]

# Railway config for Frontend (React/Vite)
# Set this service's Root Directory to "frontend" in Railway dashboard.
# Use Dockerfile so dist/ is built in-image and served reliably (avoids Nixpacks 404).

[deploy]
# Image CMD already runs serve -s dist; override only if needed (shell expands PORT)
startCommand = "/bin/sh -c 'exec serve -s dist -l ${PORT:-8080}'"
# If Railway detects static site, you may only need publish directory:
# watchPatterns = ["dist"]
